# Deploying the server.
First you have to run:
```
Deployment requires obtaining a secret SSH key to the EC2 instance
```
You need to have Nodejs, Express, and other dependencies installed --> NPM I
```

To build, run:
```
npm run build (OR NPX TSC)
```
To run the server in pre-deploy, you need to first send the Compiled js files, package-json, package-lock.json, .env to EC2 using Rsync

Then ssh into EC2 directory where u ran rsync, and install dependencies with npm ci

Then there are 2 modes, pre-deploy (using standard node listen on port 3000) and deploy (using pm2)

# For Postman (Testing Phase) --> make a correct PUT /authenticate request first
use the string response (authorization token)
Add it to X-Authorization for all other endpoint requests
```
```
